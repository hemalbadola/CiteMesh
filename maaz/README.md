# `maaz`

This folder captures the data architecture deliverables that define and justify the system's information model.

## Expected Deliverables
- Entity and attribute inventories with definitions
- Relationship matrices, cardinality notes, and constraint listings
- ER diagram source files and exported images
- Design rationale, user case walkthroughs, and extensibility assessments
- Sample data planning documentation and coverage checklists

## Organization Guidelines
- Separate raw diagram files, exports, and documentation into dedicated subfolders (for example, `erd/`, `docs/`, `samples/`).
- Keep versioned artifacts under a `versions/` subtree when multiple iterations are retained.
- Use README notes within subfolders to describe tooling or file dependencies.
- Store large binary assets under a `media/` subfolder and reference them from documentation instead of embedding.
