# `naincy`

This folder holds all integration, QA, demo preparation, and coordination assets for the project.

## Expected Deliverables
- Integration scripts and automation assets
- QA plans, test runs, and validation reports
- Demo preparation materials, including scripts and visuals
- Project management trackers and coordination notes

## Organization Guidelines
- Group related items in clearly named subfolders (for example, `qa/`, `demo/`, `integration/`).
- Use date-prefixed filenames (YYYY-MM-DD) where chronological order matters.
- Include short README files in any subfolder that needs additional context.
- Archive superseded documents in an `archive/` subfolder instead of deleting them.
